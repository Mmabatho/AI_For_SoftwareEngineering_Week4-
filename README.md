## ðŸ§  AI Development Project â€“ Theoretical and Practical Exploration

This project covers a comprehensive introduction to AI using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and spaCy. It is divided into three major parts: theoretical understanding, hands-on practical implementation, and ethics in AI tasks.

# âœ… Part 1: Theoretical Understanding â€“ Summary

## ðŸ“Œ1. Short Answer Questions

3 questions were answered.

Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

## ðŸ“Œ2. Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

```
| Feature         | Scikit-learn                        | TensorFlow                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Target Use**  | Classical ML: SVM, Random Forests   | Deep Learning: Neural Networks      |
| **Ease of Use** | Very beginner-friendly              | Steeper learning curve              |
| **Community**   | Strong in academia and ML tutorials | Large global backing + industry use |
```

# âœ… Part 2: Practical Implementation â€“ Detailed Summary & Responses

## ðŸ”· Task 1: Classical Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

We Used Scikit-learn to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict iris flower species. 
Our Outcome: A simple, interpretable ML model capable of classifying iris species with decent performance using basic metrics.

# ðŸ”· Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch (MNIST Classification)

We Build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
Outcome: A performant CNN achieving >95% accuracy, with sample predictions visualized to demonstrate understanding of model performance.


# Task3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

## Overview
This Kaggle notebook implements predictive analytics for resource allocation using the Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to predict issue priority levels (High/Medium/Low) based on diagnostic features.

## Dataset
- *Source*: Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset (Wisconsin Diagnostic)
- *Features*: 30 diagnostic measurements
- *Target*: Priority levels derived from diagnosis and severity indicators

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- âœ… Data cleaning and exploration
- âœ… Priority label creation based on diagnosis and severity
- âœ… Feature selection (top 10 most relevant features)
- âœ… Data splitting (80/20 train/test)
- âœ… Feature scaling using StandardScaler

### 2. Model Training
- âœ… Random Forest Classifier implementation
- âœ… Hyperparameter tuning
- âœ… Feature importance analysis

### 3. Model Evaluation
- âœ… Accuracy score calculation
- âœ… F1-score (macro and weighted)
- âœ… Detailed classification report
- âœ… Confusion matrix analysis
- âœ… Per-class performance metrics

## Key Results
- *Accuracy*: ~95%+ expected
- *F1-Score (Macro)*: ~90%+ expected
- *Model*: Random Forest with 100 estimators
