## ðŸ§  AI Development Project â€“ Theoretical and Practical Exploration

This project covers a comprehensive introduction to AI using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and spaCy. It is divided into three major parts: theoretical understanding, hands-on practical implementation, and ethics in AI tasks.

# âœ… Part 1: Theoretical Understanding â€“ Summary

## ðŸ“Œ1. Short Answer Questions

3 questions were answered.

Q1: Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?

Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.

Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?

Focus:

Understanding AI-driven code generation tools and their impact on development speed and limitations.

Comparing supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for automated bug detection.

Emphasizing the importance of bias mitigation in AI-powered user experience personalization.

Analyzing how AIOps improves software deployment efficiency through automation and predictive analytics.


# âœ… Part 2: Practical Implementation 

## ðŸ”· Task 1:AI-Powered Code Completion

What was done:
Used GitHub Copilot to generate a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a given key. Compared the AI-generated code with a manual implementation.

Focus:
Evaluated efficiency, readability, and conciseness of AI-generated versus manually written code.

Outcome:
The AI-suggested solution was more succinct and leveraged Pythonâ€™s built-in capabilities effectively, resulting in better maintainability and performance.

# ðŸ”· Task 2: Automated Testing with AI

What was done:
Automated login page test cases using Selenium IDE enhanced with AI plugins. Tests covered both valid and invalid credential scenarios.

Focus:
Assessed how AI enhances test coverage, adaptability to UI changes, and reduces manual testing effort.

Outcome:
AI-driven tests provided robust coverage, dynamically adjusted to interface updates, and improved test reliability, reducing the need for frequent test script maintenance.


# Task3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

## Overview
This Kaggle notebook implements predictive analytics for resource allocation using the Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to predict issue priority levels (High/Medium/Low) based on diagnostic features.

## Dataset
- *Source*: Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset (Wisconsin Diagnostic)
- *Features*: 30 diagnostic measurements
- *Target*: Priority levels derived from diagnosis and severity indicators

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- âœ… Data cleaning and exploration
- âœ… Priority label creation based on diagnosis and severity
- âœ… Feature selection (top 10 most relevant features)
- âœ… Data splitting (80/20 train/test)
- âœ… Feature scaling using StandardScaler

### 2. Model Training
- âœ… Random Forest Classifier implementation
- âœ… Hyperparameter tuning
- âœ… Feature importance analysis

### 3. Model Evaluation
- âœ… Accuracy score calculation
- âœ… F1-score (macro and weighted)
- âœ… Detailed classification report
- âœ… Confusion matrix analysis
- âœ… Per-class performance metrics

## Key Results
- *Accuracy*: ~95%+ expected
- *F1-Score (Macro)*: ~90%+ expected
- *Model*: Random Forest with 100 estimators
