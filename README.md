# Task3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

## Overview
This Kaggle notebook implements predictive analytics for resource allocation using the Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to predict issue priority levels (High/Medium/Low) based on diagnostic features.

## Dataset
- *Source*: Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset (Wisconsin Diagnostic)
- *Features*: 30 diagnostic measurements
- *Target*: Priority levels derived from diagnosis and severity indicators

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- ✅ Data cleaning and exploration
- ✅ Priority label creation based on diagnosis and severity
- ✅ Feature selection (top 10 most relevant features)
- ✅ Data splitting (80/20 train/test)
- ✅ Feature scaling using StandardScaler

### 2. Model Training
- ✅ Random Forest Classifier implementation
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning
- ✅ Feature importance analysis

### 3. Model Evaluation
- ✅ Accuracy score calculation
- ✅ F1-score (macro and weighted)
- ✅ Detailed classification report
- ✅ Confusion matrix analysis
- ✅ Per-class performance metrics

## Key Results
- *Accuracy*: ~95%+ expected
- *F1-Score (Macro)*: ~90%+ expected
- *Model*: Random Forest with 100 estimators
