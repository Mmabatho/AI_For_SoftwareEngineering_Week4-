## PowerLearn Academy Login Test Automation

This test suite validates authentication on PowerLearn Academy's platform through Testim.io, covering critical login scenarios:

- **Valid Login**: Uses secured credentials to verify successful dashboard redirection and user-specific element visibility.

- **Invalid Login**: Confirms system rejection of incorrect credentials by checking persistent login page URL, error messaging ("Invalid credentials"), and retained button functionality.

### Why AI Automation Matters:

- *Efficiency*: AI executes repetitive tests 10x faster than manual efforts, enabling daily regression checks.

- *Adaptability*: Testim's AI self-heals locators when UIs change, reducing maintenance by 40%.

- *Accuracy*: Eliminates human error in validation, ensuring 100% consistent checks for security-critical flows.

- *Scalability*: AI-driven tests run cross-browser/parallel, accelerating release cycles while maintaining quality.

- *Insight Generation*: AI analyzes failure patterns to predict vulnerabilities before production deployment.
